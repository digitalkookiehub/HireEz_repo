      "question_type": "domain_specific",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "The main modes are: (1) Road/Trucking - most flexible, door-to-door delivery, suitable for short to medium distances, but affected by traffic and weather; (2) Rail - cost-effective for heavy, bulk goods over long distances, but limited to rail networks and slower; (3) Air - fastest mode for long distances, ideal for high-value and time-sensitive goods, but most expensive; (4) Sea/Ocean - cheapest per unit for large volumes over international distances, but slowest; (5) Pipeline - used for liquids, gases, and slurries, very cost-effective but limited to specific products. Intermodal transportation combines multiple modes to optimize cost, speed, and reliability.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "FTL means a single shipper uses an entire truck for their shipment, typically for loads over 10,000 pounds or filling the trailer. LTL means multiple shippers share space on the same truck, suitable for smaller shipments typically between 150 and 10,000 pounds. FTL is chosen when shipment volume justifies a full truck, when faster transit is needed since there are no intermediate stops, or when goods cannot be mixed with other freight. LTL is chosen for smaller shipments to reduce costs, when transit time is flexible, and when budget is a primary concern. FTL has lower per-unit costs for large shipments, while LTL is more economical for smaller loads.",

      "expected_answer": "Hours of Service regulations set maximum driving and on-duty times for commercial motor vehicle drivers to prevent fatigue-related accidents. Key rules include: 11-hour driving limit after 10 consecutive hours off duty, 14-hour on-duty window, 30-minute break requirement after 8 cumulative hours of driving, 60/70-hour limit over 7/8 consecutive days, and the 34-hour restart provision. Drivers must use Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) to record their hours. These regulations are enforced by the FMCSA and are critical for road safety, driver health, and regulatory compliance.

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Route optimization is the process of determining the most efficient paths for delivery vehicles to minimize costs, time, and fuel consumption while meeting all delivery requirements. Factors include: delivery time windows, vehicle capacity and weight limits, driver hours of service, traffic patterns and road conditions, fuel costs, toll roads, customer priority levels, loading and unloading times at each stop, vehicle type restrictions in certain areas, weather conditions, backhaul opportunities, and regulatory requirements. Modern route optimization uses algorithms that consider these variables simultaneously and can dynamically adjust routes based on real-time conditions.",

      "expected_answer": "A common carrier provides transportation services to the general public at published rates and must accept all legal freight, examples include UPS and FedEx. A contract carrier operates under specific agreements with select shippers, offering customized services and negotiated rates, and is not obligated to serve the general public. A private carrier is a company that transports its own goods using its own fleet, like Walmart's private fleet. Key differences include regulatory obligations, pricing flexibility, service scope, and liability. Many companies use a combination of all three based on their shipping needs, cost considerations, and service requirements.",

Improvement strategies include: driver training programs on eco-driving techniques, speed governing and idle-reduction technologies, route optimization to minimize miles driven, regular vehicle maintenance especially tire pressure and engine tuning, aerodynamic improvements like side skirts and trailer tails, using telematics to monitor driving behavior, load optimization to maximize payload, adopting fuel-efficient vehicles or alternative fuels, strategic fuel purchasing programs, and reducing empty miles through better backhaul planning.",

Key terms include EXW (Ex Works), FOB (Free on Board), CIF (Cost Insurance and Freight), DDP (Delivered Duty Paid), and others. They determine who arranges and pays for transportation, insurance, customs clearance, and at what point risk transfers from seller to buyer. They are essential for avoiding disputes, accurately costing shipments, determining insurance needs, and ensuring clear communication between trading partners across different countries.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Intermodal transportation uses two or more modes of transport in a single journey, typically combining truck and rail using standardized containers that transfer between modes without handling the cargo itself. It is most effective for shipments traveling over 500 miles where rail's lower per-mile cost outweighs the additional drayage and handling costs, for non-time-critical shipments that can tolerate 1-2 extra days in transit, for environmentally conscious shippers seeking to reduce carbon emissions, and when highway capacity is constrained. Benefits include 10-40% cost savings over long-haul trucking, reduced carbon footprint, and reduced highway congestion. Challenges include longer transit times, limited flexibility, and potential for intermodal terminal delays.",

      "question_type": "domain_specific",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Freight brokers act as intermediaries between shippers who need to move goods and carriers who have transportation capacity. They match loads with available trucks, negotiate rates, coordinate logistics, and facilitate communication between parties. Brokers provide value by offering access to a large network of carriers, providing market rate expertise, handling paperwork and compliance, offering surge capacity during peak periods, and allowing shippers to manage transportation without maintaining direct relationships with hundreds of carriers. Brokers must hold a FMCSA broker authority license and a surety bond. They earn revenue through the spread between what shippers pay and what carriers receive.",

      "expected_answer": "Transportation pricing is influenced by: distance and lanes, shipment weight and dimensions, freight class and commodity type, market supply and demand, seasonal fluctuations, accessorial services required, equipment type, origin and destination markets, lead time, and volume commitment. Fuel surcharges are variable charges added to base freight rates to account for fluctuating fuel costs. They are typically calculated using a formula based on the DOE national average diesel price, with a base price threshold and a per-gallon increment. For example, for every cent increase above the base price, the surcharge might increase by a set percentage. This protects both carriers and shippers from volatile fuel price swings.",

A carrier with the lowest freight rate might have higher total costs due to poor reliability causing expedites, higher damage rates, or longer transit times increasing inventory costs.

It contains shipment details including shipper and consignee information, description of goods, weight, freight class, and special handling instructions. A Freight Bill is the invoice from the carrier to the shipper or consignee for transportation services rendered, detailing charges including base rate, fuel surcharges, and accessorial fees. The BOL is created at the time of pickup and is essential for claims processing, while the freight bill is generated after delivery for payment purposes.",
