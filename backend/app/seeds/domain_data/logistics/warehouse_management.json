      "question_text": "What is the difference between FIFO and LIFO inventory rotation methods, and when would you use each in a warehouse setting?",
      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "FIFO (First In, First Out) means the oldest stock is shipped first, which is ideal for perishable goods, food, pharmaceuticals, and items with expiration dates. LIFO (Last In, First Out) means the newest stock is shipped first, which can be used for non-perishable goods like building materials or coal where degradation is not a concern. FIFO is the most common method in warehousing as it minimizes obsolescence and spoilage.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Slotting optimization is the process of strategically assigning products to specific storage locations within a warehouse to maximize picking efficiency, reduce travel time, and improve space utilization. High-velocity items are placed in easily accessible locations near shipping areas, while slow-moving items are stored in less accessible zones. It considers factors like product size, weight, pick frequency, and order patterns. Proper slotting can reduce pick times by 20-30%, lower labor costs, and decrease worker fatigue.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "The main picking methods are: (1) Discrete/Single Order Picking where one order is picked at a time, suitable for low-volume operations; (2) Batch Picking where multiple orders are picked simultaneously, efficient for orders with common SKUs; (3) Zone Picking where the warehouse is divided into zones and pickers stay in assigned zones, ideal for large warehouses; (4) Wave Picking which combines batch and zone picking scheduled in waves, suited for high-volume operations; (5) Cluster Picking where multiple orders are picked into separate containers on one cart. The choice depends on order volume, SKU count, warehouse size, and order profiles.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Cross-docking is a logistics practice where incoming goods are unloaded from inbound vehicles and directly loaded onto outbound vehicles with minimal or no storage time in between. Advantages include reduced storage costs, faster delivery times, lower handling costs, reduced inventory holding, and improved product freshness for perishables. Disadvantages include high coordination requirements, need for reliable suppliers and carriers, complex scheduling, vulnerability to delays, significant initial technology investment, and limited suitability for products requiring quality inspection or value-added services.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Warehouse space utilization is calculated by dividing the total used storage space by the total available storage space, multiplied by 100. This includes both floor space and cubic space utilization. An optimal utilization rate is generally between 80-85%. Below 80% suggests underutilized space and wasted costs. Above 85-90% can lead to congestion, reduced picking efficiency, safety hazards, and inability to handle demand spikes. Cubic utilization considers vertical space and is calculated by measuring the volume of stored goods versus total available volume.",

      "expected_answer": "ABC analysis categorizes inventory into three groups based on their value and volume contribution: A items are high-value items that represent about 20% of SKUs but 80% of total value, requiring tight controls and prime warehouse locations. B items are moderate-value items representing about 30% of SKUs and 15% of value. C items are low-value items representing about 50% of SKUs but only 5% of value. Implementation involves ranking all SKUs by annual consumption value, assigning categories, and then tailoring storage locations, counting frequency, reorder policies, and security measures accordingly.",

      "expected_answer": "A traditional warehouse primarily focuses on storage of goods for extended periods with less emphasis on rapid throughput. A distribution center (DC) is designed for high-speed movement of goods with minimal storage time, acting as a hub for receiving, sorting, and redistributing products. DCs emphasize throughput speed, have more dock doors relative to size, use more automation, operate longer hours, and focus on order fulfillment. Warehouses prioritize storage capacity and cost-effective long-term holding. DCs serve as strategic nodes in the supply chain for value-added services like kitting, labeling, and returns processing.",

      "expected_answer": "Cycle counting is an ongoing inventory auditing method where a subset of inventory is counted on a rotating schedule throughout the year, rather than counting all inventory at once. It differs from a full physical inventory in that it does not require shutting down operations, is less disruptive, allows for more frequent accuracy checks, and enables quicker identification and correction of discrepancies. It is typically guided by ABC analysis where A items are counted most frequently. Full physical inventory counts everything at once, usually annually, and requires significant operational disruption. Cycle counting maintains higher ongoing accuracy and supports continuous improvement.",
