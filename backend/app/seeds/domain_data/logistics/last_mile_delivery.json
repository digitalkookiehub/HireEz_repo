      "question_type": "domain_specific",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Last mile delivery refers to the final leg of the delivery process, moving goods from a distribution hub or fulfillment center to the end customer's doorstep. It is the most expensive segment, typically accounting for 40-53% of total shipping costs, because of several factors: deliveries are made to numerous individual addresses rather than consolidated bulk shipments; routes are complex with frequent stops, varying traffic conditions, and access constraints; failed delivery attempts due to customer absence require costly redelivery; customer expectations for speed, flexibility, and free delivery compress margins; urban congestion, parking restrictions, and building access challenges slow drivers; the high ratio of labor cost per package compared to line-haul transport; and variability in package sizes and delivery requirements. It is also the most visible part of the supply chain to the end customer, making it a critical differentiator for customer experience and brand perception.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Route optimization uses algorithms to determine the most efficient delivery sequences and paths. Key factors include: delivery time windows requested by customers, vehicle capacity constraints for both weight and volume, driver hours of service and shift duration, real-time traffic conditions and historical traffic patterns, geographic clustering of deliveries to minimize drive time between stops, road restrictions such as truck height limits, one-way streets, and residential access rules, priority deliveries requiring earliest or specific time slots, vehicle type matching to delivery requirements such as refrigerated goods needing reefer vehicles, fuel efficiency considerations, left-turn avoidance in some markets to reduce idle time and accidents, and dynamic rerouting capability for same-day additions or cancellations. Advanced route optimization platforms use algorithms based on variations of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), incorporating machine learning to improve accuracy over time. Effective optimization typically reduces total miles driven by 10-30%, increases deliveries per driver per day, and improves on-time performance.",

      "question_type": "domain_specific",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Urban last mile delivery presents distinct challenges: traffic congestion significantly reduces the number of stops achievable per hour compared to suburban areas; limited parking and loading zones force drivers to double-park or walk long distances from the vehicle; high-rise apartment buildings and office complexes require navigating security systems, elevators, and long hallways, increasing dwell time per stop; restricted vehicle access in pedestrian zones, low-emission zones, and narrow streets limits vehicle type options; higher density of deliveries means more frequent stops but also more time per stop; noise restrictions may limit delivery hours in residential areas; security concerns in some neighborhoods affect driver safety; and congestion charges in cities like London add direct costs. However, urban areas also offer advantages: higher delivery density means more stops per route, customers are closer together reducing drive time, and the concentration of population supports alternative models like cargo bikes, walking couriers, and micro-fulfillment centers that are not viable in lower-density areas.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Delivery density refers to the number of delivery stops within a given geographic area, typically measured as stops per square mile or stops per route hour. It is the most critical factor in last mile economics because it directly determines the ratio of productive time, meaning time spent actually delivering, versus unproductive time spent driving between stops. Higher density means: more deliveries per driver per hour, directly reducing cost per delivery; less fuel consumed per delivery; shorter total route miles; better asset utilization of vehicles and drivers; and the ability to offer tighter delivery windows because routes are more compact. Even a modest increase in density, such as going from 10 to 12 stops per hour, can reduce cost per delivery by 15-20%. Strategies to increase density include: offering incentives for customers to choose specific delivery days, batching deliveries by neighborhood or zone, partnering with multiple merchants in the same area, using pickup points to consolidate demand, and marketing to increase customer adoption in underserved but high-potential areas. The economics of last mile delivery fundamentally depend on achieving sufficient density to make individual deliveries profitable.",

      "question_type": "domain_specific",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Accelerated delivery expectations fundamentally change last mile operations: same-day delivery requires orders to be cut off and processed within hours rather than overnight batches, demanding real-time order processing, inventory positioned close to customers in urban fulfillment centers, and multiple delivery waves per day rather than single morning dispatches; this reduces route optimization effectiveness because there is less time to accumulate orders and build efficient routes with high density; it requires more vehicles and drivers on standby to handle unpredictable order volumes; warehouse operations must shift from batch processing to continuous flow; inventory must be pre-positioned across more locations, increasing inventory costs; and the overall cost per delivery for same-day can be two to three times higher than standard next-day. Next-day delivery, while less extreme, still requires efficient cut-off-to-dispatch processes and regional fulfillment capabilities. The economic challenge is that customers expect these faster services at low or no cost, creating margin pressure. Successful operators offset this through higher delivery density in urban areas, premium pricing for same-day service, using predictive analytics to pre-position inventory, and leveraging micro-fulfillment and dark stores to reduce the last mile distance.",

The response should demonstrate planning ability, scalable process design, and attention to both speed and quality.",

      "question_text": "A new competitor has entered your market offering free same-day delivery, and your company is losing customers. You have been asked to develop a competitive response without matching their pricing. What strategy would you propose?",
      "question_type": "situational",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Developing a competitive response without a price war requires differentiation on value rather than cost: first, analyze the competitor's offering to understand their coverage area, service quality, reliability, and whether their pricing is sustainable or a market entry loss leader; focus on service quality differentiation by offering superior reliability with tighter on-time guarantees, better real-time tracking and communication, more flexible delivery options including precise time windows, evening and weekend slots, and alternative pickup locations; invest in customer experience by improving delivery driver professionalism and interactions, enhancing the post-delivery experience with proactive feedback collection and rapid issue resolution; offer value-added services the competitor does not, such as white-glove delivery, installation, scheduled recurring deliveries, or specialized handling for fragile items; leverage data and personalization to offer delivery preferences tailored to individual customers based on their history; strengthen B2B and enterprise relationships with dedicated service levels and account management; improve operational efficiency to fund targeted promotions for at-risk customer segments without across-the-board price reductions; build loyalty programs that reward repeat customers; and develop partnerships with premium brands that value delivery quality over lowest cost. Present a phased plan with quick wins and longer-term strategic initiatives with ROI projections.",
