      "expected_answer": "The Hierarchy of Controls is a framework used to prioritize hazard control methods from most effective to least effective. The five levels are: 1) Elimination, physically removing the hazard entirely (e.g., redesigning a process to avoid a dangerous chemical). 2) Substitution, replacing the hazard with something less dangerous (e.g., using a less toxic solvent). 3) Engineering Controls, isolating people from the hazard through physical modifications (e.g., machine guarding, ventilation systems, noise enclosures). 4) Administrative Controls, changing the way people work through procedures, training, job rotation, signage, and scheduling to limit exposure. 5) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), providing protective gear such as gloves, respirators, and safety glasses as the last line of defense. The most effective approach combines multiple levels, and PPE should never be the sole control measure when higher-level controls are feasible.",

      "expected_answer": "A Job Hazard Analysis, also called a Job Safety Analysis (JSA), is a systematic process for identifying potential hazards associated with each step of a specific job or task and determining the best way to control or eliminate those hazards. The process involves: 1) Selecting the job to be analyzed, prioritizing high-risk, injury-prone, or new tasks. 2) Breaking the job into sequential steps by observing a trained worker performing the task. 3) Identifying potential hazards at each step, considering what could go wrong, what are the consequences, and what contributing factors exist. 4) Determining preventive measures for each hazard, applying the Hierarchy of Controls. 5) Documenting the analysis and communicating findings to all workers performing the task. JHAs should be reviewed and updated whenever the job changes, after incidents, or on a regular schedule. They are powerful tools for engaging workers in safety and identifying hazards before incidents occur.",

      "expected_answer": "A hazard assessment focuses on identifying potential sources of harm in the workplace, such as chemical exposures, unguarded machinery, electrical hazards, fall risks, or ergonomic stressors. It answers the question: what can cause harm? A risk assessment goes further by evaluating both the likelihood of a hazard causing harm and the severity of the potential consequences, typically expressed as Risk equals Likelihood multiplied by Severity. This allows prioritization of hazards based on their overall risk level (high, medium, low), enabling more effective allocation of resources to address the most significant risks first. In practice, a hazard assessment is often the first step within a broader risk assessment process. Risk assessments also consider existing controls and determine whether additional measures are needed to reduce risk to an acceptable level.",

Gather facts through interviews with witnesses and involved parties, review of relevant documents (procedures, training records, maintenance logs), and examination of physical evidence. Apply systematic analytical methods such as the 5 Whys technique to drill down from the immediate cause to deeper systemic causes, a Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram to categorize contributing factors (people, procedures, equipment, environment, management), or a Fault Tree Analysis for complex events. Identify both direct causes (unsafe acts, unsafe conditions) and root causes (systemic failures in management systems, training, design, or culture).

Examples include Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), severity rate, workers' compensation costs, and fatalities. While important for benchmarking and regulatory compliance, they only tell you about failures that have already occurred. Leading indicators measure proactive safety activities and conditions that predict future safety performance. Examples include number of safety observations completed, near-miss reporting rates, safety training completion percentages, hazard identification and correction rates, safety audit scores, management safety walk-through frequency, and percentage of corrective actions completed on time. An effective safety management system tracks both types but emphasizes leading indicators because they provide opportunities to prevent incidents before they occur. The ratio of leading to lagging indicators should heavily favor leading indicators.",

Audits follow a structured methodology: planning (scope, criteria, audit team), document review, on-site assessment (interviews, observations, record review), findings classification (non-conformance, observation, opportunity for improvement), reporting, and corrective action follow-up. A safety inspection, by contrast, is a physical examination of the workplace to identify hazards, unsafe conditions, and unsafe behaviors at a specific point in time. Inspections focus on the current physical state of the workplace rather than the management system. Both are necessary: audits evaluate whether the safety management system is designed and functioning correctly, while inspections verify that the physical workplace meets safety standards on a day-to-day basis. Audits are typically conducted annually or periodically, while inspections occur more frequently.",
