      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "MRP (Material Requirements Planning) is a system that calculates the materials and components needed for production based on the bill of materials, current inventory levels, and the master production schedule. It determines what to order, how much to order, and when to order. MRP II (Manufacturing Resource Planning) extends MRP by integrating additional functions such as capacity planning, shop floor control, financial planning, and demand management. MRP II provides a more comprehensive view of manufacturing operations by linking production planning with business and financial planning. Together, they help supply chain professionals ensure materials arrive on time, production capacity is available, and costs are controlled.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "The bullwhip effect refers to the phenomenon where small fluctuations in consumer demand become amplified as orders move upstream through the supply chain, causing progressively larger swings in inventory and ordering at each tier. This results in excess inventory, stockouts, inefficient production scheduling, and increased costs. Mitigation strategies include: sharing point-of-sale data across the supply chain for better demand visibility, implementing Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), using Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR), reducing order lead times, eliminating order batching through more frequent smaller orders, stabilizing pricing to reduce forward buying, and implementing demand-driven replenishment rather than forecast-driven ordering.",

Key components include: acquisition costs (unit price, tooling, minimum order quantities), logistics costs (freight, customs duties, insurance, warehousing), quality costs (inspection, rework, scrap, warranty claims, returns), operational costs (lead time variability, safety stock requirements, expediting), administrative costs (purchase order processing, supplier audits, communication), risk costs (supply disruption, currency fluctuation, geopolitical risk), and end-of-life costs (disposal, recycling). TCO analysis enables more informed supplier selection by revealing hidden costs that may make a seemingly cheaper supplier more expensive overall.",

      "expected_answer": "The Economic Order Quantity model calculates the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total inventory costs, which consist of ordering costs (purchase orders, receiving, inspection) and holding costs (storage, insurance, obsolescence, capital cost). The EOQ formula is the square root of (2 times annual demand times ordering cost per order divided by annual holding cost per unit). Key assumptions include constant and known demand, fixed ordering and holding costs, instantaneous replenishment, and no quantity discounts. Limitations include that real-world demand fluctuates, lead times vary, quantity discounts often exist, and items may have shelf-life constraints. Despite these limitations, EOQ provides a useful starting point for inventory ordering decisions.",

      "expected_answer": "A push strategy produces goods based on forecasted demand before customer orders are received. Production and inventory decisions are driven by long-term demand predictions. This works well for products with stable, predictable demand, long production lead times, or when economies of scale are significant. A pull strategy produces goods in response to actual customer demand, triggering production and replenishment only when orders are placed. This minimizes inventory and waste but requires shorter lead times and flexible production. Many companies use a hybrid push-pull strategy where the decoupling point separates push activities (upstream, forecast-driven) from pull activities (downstream, demand-driven). The optimal strategy depends on demand variability, lead times, product customization, and cost structure.",

      "question_type": "technical",

      "expected_answer": "Safety stock is the extra inventory held to buffer against uncertainty in demand and supply lead times. The basic calculation uses the formula: Safety Stock equals the Z-score (service level factor) multiplied by the standard deviation of demand during lead time. Factors influencing the required level include: demand variability (higher variability requires more safety stock), lead time variability (longer and more variable lead times increase the need), desired service level (higher service level targets require more buffer), forecast accuracy (less accurate forecasts need more safety stock), supplier reliability (unreliable suppliers require more buffer), and product criticality (mission-critical items may justify higher levels). Balancing safety stock involves trading off between the cost of carrying excess inventory and the cost of stockouts.",

Items are classified into three categories: A items represent roughly 10-20% of items but 70-80% of total inventory value, requiring tight control, frequent review, accurate forecasting, and low safety stock with frequent replenishment. B items represent about 30% of items and 15-25% of value, requiring moderate control and periodic review. C items represent 50-60% of items but only 5-10% of value, managed with simple controls, higher safety stock, and less frequent review. This classification helps companies allocate management attention and resources proportionally to the financial impact of each item category, optimizing both service levels and inventory investment.",

First, conduct a thorough risk assessment of the supplier including financial health, geopolitical exposure, natural disaster vulnerability, and capacity constraints. Develop a dual-sourcing or multi-sourcing qualification plan to identify and qualify alternative suppliers, even if not immediately used. Negotiate long-term contracts with the existing supplier that include capacity guarantees, business continuity clauses, and penalties for non-performance. Build strategic safety stock for critical components. Establish regular supplier audits and scorecards to monitor performance trends.

It integrates historical sales data, market trends, promotional plans, economic indicators, and customer input to generate demand forecasts. These forecasts feed into the Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process, where they are reconciled with supply capabilities, capacity, and financial targets. Demand plans drive master production schedules, material procurement, workforce planning, and logistics capacity. Effective demand planning reduces excess inventory, minimizes stockouts, improves customer service levels, and enables better resource allocation. Common forecasting methods include time-series analysis, causal models, and collaborative forecasting with customers and sales teams.",

Schedule a supplier quality review meeting to present the data and discuss concerns. Negotiate tighter internal specifications or request the supplier implement process controls to center their output. Establish an enhanced monitoring program with more frequent inspections and SPC data sharing.

Risks include dependency on supplier performance and systems, loss of direct control over inventory, data security concerns from sharing sensitive information, potential for supplier prioritizing other customers, and challenges if the relationship ends.

BOM accuracy is critical because MRP systems depend on it to calculate material requirements and generate purchase orders. An inaccurate BOM leads to ordering wrong quantities (either shortages causing production delays or excess inventory), incorrect cost estimates, production floor confusion, quality issues from wrong components, and unreliable delivery commitments to customers.
