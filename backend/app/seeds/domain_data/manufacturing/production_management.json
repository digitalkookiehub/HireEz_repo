      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Production planning is the broader, longer-term activity that determines what products to manufacture, in what quantities, and over what time horizons, based on demand forecasts and sales orders. It addresses capacity requirements, material needs, and resource allocation at a strategic level. Production scheduling is the more detailed, shorter-term activity that determines the specific sequence and timing of jobs on machines and work centers, assigning start and end dates for each operation. Planning answers 'what and how much' while scheduling answers 'when and in what order.' They work together because planning sets the framework and constraints within which scheduling optimizes the daily execution.",

      "expected_answer": "OEE is a metric that measures how effectively manufacturing equipment is utilized. It is calculated as the product of three components: Availability (actual run time divided by planned production time, accounting for downtime losses like breakdowns and changeovers), Performance (actual throughput rate divided by maximum theoretical rate, accounting for speed losses like slow cycles and minor stops), and Quality (good units produced divided by total units produced, accounting for defect losses including scrap and rework). OEE = Availability x Performance x Quality. World-class OEE is generally considered to be 85% or higher. OEE helps identify the biggest sources of productivity loss (the 'six big losses') and prioritize improvement efforts.",

      "expected_answer": "A Bill of Materials is a comprehensive list of raw materials, components, sub-assemblies, and their quantities required to manufacture a finished product. It is structured hierarchically showing parent-child relationships between assemblies and components. The BOM is critical for production management because it drives material requirements planning (MRP), enables accurate costing, supports inventory management, guides purchasing decisions, ensures correct materials are available for production, and serves as a reference for engineering changes. BOMs can be single-level or multi-level (indented), and types include engineering BOM, manufacturing BOM, and sales BOM.",

MRP performs a 'netting' calculation to determine gross requirements, subtract available inventory and scheduled receipts, and generate net requirements. It then applies lead times to determine when orders must be placed (time-phasing), creating planned order releases for purchasing and production.",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "The Theory of Constraints, developed by Eliyahu Goldratt, states that every system has at least one constraint (bottleneck) that limits its throughput. The five focusing steps of TOC are: 1) Identify the constraint (the resource limiting overall system output), 2) Exploit the constraint (maximize its utilization, ensure it never starves or is blocked), 3) Subordinate everything else to the constraint (align all other resources to support the bottleneck), 4) Elevate the constraint (invest to increase its capacity), and 5) Repeat (once the constraint is broken, find the new constraint). In production management, this means scheduling around the bottleneck, using drum-buffer-rope scheduling, and focusing improvement efforts on the true constraint rather than non-bottleneck resources.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Make-to-stock (MTS) produces finished goods based on demand forecasts and stores them as inventory for immediate customer delivery. It suits high-volume, standardized products with predictable demand. Make-to-order (MTO) begins production only after receiving a customer order, offering customization but with longer lead times. It suits customized or low-volume products. Assemble-to-order (ATO) is a hybrid approach where standard sub-assemblies and components are made to stock, but final assembly is triggered by customer orders, offering some customization with shorter lead times. Each strategy involves different trade-offs between inventory investment, lead time, customization flexibility, and demand risk.",

It typically contains: operation numbers and sequence, work center or machine assignments for each operation, setup time and run time per unit, tooling requirements, quality inspection points, labor skill requirements, and any special instructions. Routings are essential for scheduling, capacity planning, costing, and shop floor execution.

      "expected_answer": "Takt time is the rate at which products need to be completed to meet customer demand. It is calculated by dividing the available production time by the customer demand rate for that period. For example, if available time is 480 minutes per shift and demand is 240 units per shift, takt time is 2 minutes per unit. Takt time is used to balance production lines by distributing work elements so each station's cycle time is at or below takt time. It provides a rhythm for production, helps identify over- or under-capacity situations, guides staffing decisions, and reveals bottlenecks where cycle time exceeds takt time. It is a fundamental concept in lean manufacturing for synchronizing production with demand.",

It translates the aggregate production plan into specific product schedules. The MPS is developed by considering: customer orders and forecasts, current inventory levels, desired safety stock levels, production capacity constraints, and company policies on lot sizing and lead times. It serves as the primary input to MRP and drives detailed material and capacity planning. The MPS must be realistic, achievable, and regularly reviewed and adjusted through a process called master schedule management.",

      "expected_answer": "The diagnostic approach should include: collecting OEE data to identify whether the loss is from availability, performance, or quality, analyzing downtime logs and categorizing stoppage reasons, conducting time studies to compare actual cycle times with standards, reviewing changeover durations, interviewing operators about recurring issues, checking material quality and supply consistency, evaluating maintenance records for equipment reliability, and reviewing staffing levels and skills. Resolution steps should be prioritized based on the largest sources of loss, using tools like Pareto analysis, and should include both quick wins and longer-term structural improvements with clear accountability and tracking.",

Advantages include flexibility to produce different products, lower equipment investment, and ability to handle varying demand. Disadvantages include changeover time and costs, higher work-in-process inventory, longer lead times, and more complex scheduling. Continuous flow production involves products moving through the process without interruption. Advantages include lower per-unit costs, consistent quality, reduced work-in-process, shorter lead times, and simpler scheduling. Disadvantages include high initial investment, inflexibility for product changes, high impact of breakdowns, and requirement for stable, high-volume demand.",

It includes tasks like lubrication, filter changes, belt replacements, and inspections regardless of equipment condition. Predictive maintenance (PdM) uses condition monitoring techniques (vibration analysis, thermography, oil analysis, ultrasonic testing) to detect early signs of equipment deterioration and schedule maintenance only when needed. PM is simpler and cheaper to implement but may result in unnecessary maintenance or miss failures between intervals. PdM optimizes maintenance timing and reduces unnecessary interventions but requires more sophisticated monitoring equipment and expertise.
