      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Statistical Process Control is a method of quality control that uses statistical techniques to monitor and control a manufacturing process. It involves collecting data from production, plotting it on control charts (such as X-bar and R charts), and analyzing variation to determine if a process is in statistical control. SPC helps distinguish between common cause variation (inherent to the process) and special cause variation (due to assignable factors), allowing operators to take corrective action before defects are produced.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "AQL is the maximum percentage of defects that can be considered acceptable as a process average for sampling purposes. It represents the quality level at which lots will be accepted most of the time (typically 95% probability). LTPD is the quality level at which a lot is considered unacceptable, and lots at this defect level will be rejected most of the time (typically 90% probability). Together, AQL and LTPD define the operating characteristic curve of a sampling plan and help balance producer's risk (rejecting good lots) and consumer's risk (accepting bad lots).",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "A Gage R&R study evaluates the measurement system to determine how much of the observed process variation is due to the measurement system itself. Repeatability measures the variation when the same operator measures the same part multiple times with the same instrument. Reproducibility measures the variation when different operators measure the same part with the same instrument. The study quantifies measurement system variation as a percentage of total variation or tolerance. Generally, a Gage R&R below 10% is acceptable, 10-30% may be acceptable depending on the application, and above 30% indicates the measurement system needs improvement.",

In Measure, current process performance data is collected and baseline metrics are established. In Analyze, root causes of defects and variation are identified using statistical and analytical tools. In Improve, solutions are developed, tested, and implemented to address root causes. In Control, sustaining mechanisms like control plans and monitoring systems are put in place to maintain improvements. DMAIC is the core Six Sigma methodology for improving existing processes.",

The main types include: incoming inspection (checking raw materials and components from suppliers), in-process inspection (monitoring quality during production at various stages), final inspection (examining finished products before shipment), and patrol inspection (periodic random checks during production). Inspections can be 100% inspection (every unit) or sampling-based. Methods include visual inspection, dimensional measurement, functional testing, and non-destructive testing.",

There are two main types: Design FMEA (DFMEA) which analyzes potential design failures, and Process FMEA (PFMEA) which analyzes potential manufacturing process failures. Each potential failure mode is assessed for Severity (impact), Occurrence (likelihood), and Detection (ability to detect before reaching the customer), and a Risk Priority Number (RPN) is calculated by multiplying these three factors.

Cp only considers spread, not centering. Cpk measures actual process capability accounting for centering and is the minimum of (USL - mean) / (3 * sigma) and (mean - LSL) / (3 * sigma). A Cp of 1.0 means the process spread exactly matches the specification width. A Cpk of 1.33 or higher is generally considered capable. If Cp is much higher than Cpk, the process is off-center.

The appropriate actions include: stopping to investigate the process, looking for assignable causes such as tool wear, material changes, environmental factors, or operator changes. The candidate should check if raw material lots changed, if machine settings drifted, or if there was a maintenance event. After identifying the cause, corrective action should be taken to re-center the process.

Its purposes include ensuring measurement accuracy, maintaining traceability to national or international standards, meeting regulatory and quality system requirements, and building confidence in measurement data used for quality decisions.

FAI verifies that the production process is capable of producing parts that meet all design specifications.
