      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "A savings account is designed for depositing and accumulating funds with interest paid to the depositor, while a current account is designed for frequent transactions with no or minimal interest. Banks earn revenue from savings accounts by lending deposited funds at higher interest rates (net interest margin). For current accounts, banks earn through transaction fees, minimum balance charges, and by utilizing the float. Current accounts typically have higher transaction limits but lower or zero interest rates.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Non-Performing Assets are loans or advances where the borrower has stopped making interest or principal payments for 90 days or more. NPAs are classified into three categories: Sub-standard Assets (NPA for up to 12 months), Doubtful Assets (NPA for more than 12 months), and Loss Assets (identified as uncollectable by the bank or auditors but not yet written off). NPAs directly impact a bank's profitability, capital adequacy, and lending capacity. Banks must make provisions against NPAs which reduces their profit.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Basel III is a global regulatory framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to strengthen bank capital requirements, introduce new regulatory requirements for liquidity and leverage, and improve risk management. Key components include higher minimum capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 at 4.5%, Tier 1 at 6%, total capital at 8%), a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, a countercyclical buffer of 0-2.5%, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requiring banks to hold enough liquid assets to cover 30-day net outflows, Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and a leverage ratio. It was introduced after the 2008 financial crisis to prevent systemic banking failures.",

      "expected_answer": "KYC is the process of verifying the identity, suitability, and risks involved with maintaining a business relationship with a customer. It involves customer identification (collecting identity and address proof), customer due diligence (verifying submitted documents and assessing risk profile), and ongoing monitoring (tracking transactions for suspicious activity). KYC is critical for preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, identity theft, and financial fraud. Banks are legally required to perform KYC under anti-money laundering regulations, and failure to comply can result in heavy penalties, license revocation, and reputational damage.",

      "expected_answer": "The candidate should demonstrate ethical judgment and adherence to protocol. A strong response includes: first documenting specific instances with evidence, reporting the matter to the immediate supervisor or compliance department through proper channels, not confronting the colleague directly to avoid evidence tampering, maintaining confidentiality throughout, understanding the potential consequences including increased NPAs, regulatory penalties, and reputational risk. The response should show awareness of whistleblower protections and the importance of institutional integrity over personal relationships.",

      "expected_answer": "A Letter of Credit (LC) is a financial instrument issued by a bank guaranteeing payment to a seller on behalf of a buyer, provided the seller meets specified terms and conditions. In international trade, it reduces risk for both parties: the seller is assured of payment if they present compliant documents, and the buyer is assured goods will be shipped as per agreed terms. Key types include Revocable, Irrevocable, Confirmed, Transferable, and Back-to-Back LCs. The process involves the buyer applying for an LC from their bank (issuing bank), which sends it to the seller's bank (advising bank). The seller ships goods, submits documents, and receives payment upon document compliance.",

It involves high-volume, low-value transactions with a large customer base. Wholesale banking (also called corporate banking) serves large corporations, institutions, and government entities, offering products like corporate loans, treasury services, trade finance, cash management, and syndicated lending. It involves low-volume, high-value transactions. Retail banking generates revenue through interest margins and fees, while wholesale banking relies more on relationship-based pricing, advisory fees, and large-scale lending margins.",

      "expected_answer": "Asset-Liability Management is a practice of managing the bank's balance sheet to mitigate risks arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities. Key components include interest rate risk management (ensuring changes in rates don't adversely impact net interest income), liquidity risk management (ensuring the bank can meet its obligations as they come due), maturity gap analysis (matching the maturity profiles of assets and liabilities), and duration analysis. ALM committees (ALCO) meet regularly to review the bank's risk position, set internal limits, and make strategic decisions about pricing, product mix, and investment portfolios. Poor ALM can lead to liquidity crises, interest rate losses, or even bank failure.",

These sectors typically include agriculture, micro and small enterprises, education, housing, social infrastructure, renewable energy, and weaker sections of society. The target is usually 40% of adjusted net bank credit for domestic banks. PSL ensures inclusive growth, reduces income inequality, and channels credit to productive sectors. Banks that fail to meet targets must contribute to designated funds at lower returns. This policy helps achieve broader socioeconomic objectives through the banking system.",

      "expected_answer": "CASA ratio refers to the proportion of Current Account and Savings Account deposits to total deposits. It is calculated as (Current Account Deposits + Savings Account Deposits) / Total Deposits x 100. A higher CASA ratio is beneficial because these deposits have lower interest costs compared to fixed deposits and other term deposits, thereby reducing the overall cost of funds and improving net interest margins. Banks with higher CASA ratios are generally more profitable and have more stable, low-cost funding. Strategies to improve CASA include salary account tie-ups, digital banking features, merchant services, and superior customer service. A healthy CASA ratio is typically above 40%.",

It directly controls the money supply in the economy; a higher CRR reduces lendable funds. SLR is the percentage of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain in the form of liquid assets such as government securities, cash, and gold. SLR ensures bank solvency and channels funds to government securities. Both are monetary policy tools used by the central bank to control inflation, regulate credit growth, and ensure financial stability. Changes in CRR and SLR directly impact a bank's lending capacity and profitability.",

      "expected_answer": "Interest rate spread is the difference between the average interest rate a bank earns on its assets (loans and investments) and the average interest rate it pays on its liabilities (deposits and borrowings). For example, if a bank lends at 10% and pays depositors 6%, the spread is 4%. This spread is the primary source of income for most commercial banks. Factors affecting the spread include competitive environment, central bank policy rates, credit risk premium, operational costs, inflation expectations, and the bank's funding mix. A wider spread means higher profitability, but banks must balance this with competitive pricing to attract both borrowers and depositors.",

      "expected_answer": "A secured loan is backed by collateral (property, gold, securities, vehicles) that the bank can seize if the borrower defaults, while an unsecured loan has no collateral backing and relies solely on the borrower's creditworthiness and repayment ability. Secured loans carry lower risk for the bank, hence they typically have lower interest rates, higher loan amounts, and longer tenures. Unsecured loans carry higher risk, resulting in higher interest rates, lower loan amounts, stricter eligibility criteria, and shorter tenures. From a risk perspective, secured loans have lower loss-given-default (LGD) but can have higher operational costs for collateral management, while unsecured loans have higher LGD and require robust credit scoring models.",

      "expected_answer": "The Repo Rate is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks against government securities. The Reverse Repo Rate is the rate at which the central bank borrows money from commercial banks. When the central bank increases the Repo Rate, borrowing becomes costlier for banks, leading to higher lending rates, reduced credit growth, and lower inflation. A decrease in Repo Rate makes borrowing cheaper, stimulating lending and economic activity. The Reverse Repo Rate influences how much banks park with the central bank; a higher Reverse Repo Rate encourages banks to deposit excess funds rather than lend. Together, these rates form the corridor for short-term interest rates and are primary tools of monetary policy.",
