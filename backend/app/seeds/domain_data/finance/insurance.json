      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "The principle of Utmost Good Faith requires both the insurer and the insured to disclose all material facts honestly and transparently. The insured must disclose all relevant information that could influence the insurer's decision to accept the risk or determine the premium, such as pre-existing medical conditions in health insurance or previous claims history. The insurer must clearly explain policy terms, conditions, exclusions, and limitations. This principle is fundamental because insurance contracts are based on trust, and non-disclosure or misrepresentation can void the policy. It protects both parties and ensures fair pricing of risk.",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Term insurance provides pure life coverage for a specified period (term) and pays the death benefit only if the insured dies during the term; it has no maturity benefit or cash value and is the most affordable form of life insurance. Whole life insurance provides coverage for the insured's entire lifetime, accumulates a cash value over time, and pays a death benefit whenever the insured dies; it is significantly more expensive. Term insurance is recommended for individuals seeking maximum coverage at minimum cost, especially young families with dependents and financial obligations like mortgages. Whole life is recommended for estate planning, wealth transfer, and individuals seeking a savings component along with insurance coverage.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Underwriting is the process of evaluating and assessing the risk associated with insuring a person or asset to determine whether to accept the risk and at what premium. In life insurance, factors include age, gender, health condition, medical history, family medical history, occupation, lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol), hobbies (dangerous activities), income, and existing insurance coverage. In general insurance, factors include the type and value of the asset, location, usage, claims history, safety measures, and industry risk. The underwriter may request medical examinations, inspections, or additional documentation. The goal is to classify risks into standard, preferred, sub-standard, or declined categories and price the premium accordingly.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Reinsurance is insurance purchased by an insurance company from another insurance company (reinsurer) to transfer a portion of its risk exposure. Types include Facultative (covering specific individual risks), Treaty (covering a portfolio of risks automatically), Proportional (sharing premiums and losses in agreed proportions including Quota Share and Surplus), and Non-Proportional (the reinsurer pays only when losses exceed a certain threshold, including Excess of Loss and Stop Loss). Insurance companies need reinsurance to protect against catastrophic losses, stabilize financial results, increase underwriting capacity, improve capital efficiency, and comply with solvency requirements. Reinsurance effectively allows insurers to take on more risk than their capital alone would permit.",

      "expected_answer": "The principle of Indemnity states that insurance is meant to restore the insured to the same financial position they were in before the loss, not to allow them to profit from it. The insured can claim only the actual amount of loss, up to the sum insured. This applies primarily to general insurance (property, motor, marine). Exceptions include: Life Insurance (since human life cannot be valued monetarily, it operates on the benefit principle), Personal Accident Insurance (pays fixed benefit regardless of actual loss), Valued Policies (pay agreed value regardless of actual loss), and Reinstatement Policies (pay the cost of replacement rather than depreciated value). Related sub-principles include Subrogation (insurer's right to recover from third parties) and Contribution (sharing losses among multiple insurers).",

The response should show how they prioritized the customer's interest, adhered to regulatory guidelines (suitability assessment), communicated honestly about product limitations, and how this approach built long-term trust and business.

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "The claim ratio (or loss ratio) is the percentage of premiums collected that is paid out in claims. It is calculated as (Claims Incurred / Premiums Earned) x 100. A claim ratio of 80% means the insurer pays 80 paise in claims for every rupee of premium earned. The combined ratio adds operating expenses to the claim ratio: Combined Ratio = Loss Ratio + Expense Ratio, where Expense Ratio = (Operating Expenses / Premiums Earned) x 100. A combined ratio below 100% indicates underwriting profitability, while above 100% indicates underwriting losses. However, insurers can still be profitable overall through investment income. These ratios are key performance indicators for evaluating an insurer's operational efficiency and pricing adequacy.",

Sum Insured is the maximum amount an insurer will pay under a general insurance policy (health, property, motor); it represents the value of the insured asset or the maximum coverage limit. The key difference is that Sum Assured is a fixed benefit (paid in full regardless of actual loss in life insurance), while Sum Insured is the maximum limit of indemnity (actual loss is paid subject to this maximum in general insurance). Under-insurance occurs when the Sum Insured is less than the actual asset value.",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Moral Hazard occurs when the insured changes their behavior after obtaining insurance, becoming less careful or taking more risks because they know they are protected. For example, a person with comprehensive car insurance may drive less carefully, or a business owner may neglect fire safety after getting fire insurance. Adverse Selection occurs when individuals with higher risk are more likely to purchase insurance than those with lower risk, leading to a disproportionately high-risk pool. For example, people with known health issues are more likely to buy health insurance. Insurers manage Moral Hazard through deductibles, co-payments, no-claim bonuses, policy exclusions, and claim investigations. Adverse Selection is managed through medical underwriting, waiting periods, pre-existing disease exclusions, and differential pricing based on risk profiles.",

Key regulatory areas include: licensing of insurers and intermediaries, solvency margin requirements (ensuring companies can pay claims), product approval and pricing oversight, investment regulations (controlling where insurers invest policyholder funds), policyholder protection (grievance redressal, ombudsman), market conduct standards (preventing mis-selling and unfair practices), and financial reporting requirements. Regulation is necessary to protect policyholders from insurer insolvency, ensure fair pricing, prevent fraud, maintain market stability, promote healthy competition, and build public trust in the insurance system.",

Third-party insurance covers the policyholder's legal liability for losses or damages caused to another person or their property. Examples include third-party motor insurance (covering damage to another vehicle or person in an accident caused by the insured), professional liability insurance, and public liability insurance. In many jurisdictions, third-party motor insurance is mandatory by law, while first-party coverage is optional. Third-party claims are typically settled based on legal liability and court awards.",

It prevents the insured from receiving double compensation (from both the insurer and the at-fault party) and helps insurers recover costs, keeping premiums affordable. Practical example: If Car A (insured with Company X) is damaged by Car B running a red light, Company X pays the repair claim to Car A's owner. Company X then has the right of subrogation to recover the claim amount from Car B's owner or their insurer. The insured must cooperate with the insurer's recovery efforts and must not do anything to prejudice the insurer's subrogation rights, such as settling privately with the at-fault party.",

They are appointed and trained by the insurer and earn commissions on policies sold. An insurance broker represents the customer and works independently to find the best insurance solution across multiple insurers. Brokers conduct needs analysis, compare products from different companies, negotiate terms and premiums, and assist with claims. Brokers have fiduciary responsibility to the client, while agents have obligations to the insurer. Brokers are typically used for complex commercial risks, while agents are more common in retail insurance distribution. Both must be licensed by the regulatory authority.",

Insurance Density is measured as the ratio of total insurance premiums to the total population, expressed as per capita premium. It indicates the average insurance spending per person. Both metrics together provide a comprehensive picture of insurance market development. Low penetration and density indicate significant growth potential but also suggest gaps in insurance awareness and accessibility. Strategies to improve these metrics include increasing financial literacy, developing micro-insurance products, leveraging technology for distribution, simplifying products, and promoting regulatory support for innovative distribution models.",

Methods include Chain Ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Expected Loss Ratio, and individual case estimation. Accurate loss reserving is critical because: it determines the insurer's true profitability (understating reserves overstates profit), it affects solvency margins and regulatory compliance, it impacts pricing decisions for future products, it influences reinsurance arrangements, and it affects the insurer's credit rating. Over-reserving ties up capital unnecessarily, while under-reserving can lead to insolvency. Actuaries play a key role in estimating reserves using statistical and actuarial methods.",
