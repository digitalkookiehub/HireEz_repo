      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Lean manufacturing focuses on maximizing customer value while minimizing waste. The seven wastes are overproduction, waiting, transportation, overprocessing, inventory, motion, and defects. Some frameworks add an eighth waste: underutilized talent. Eliminating these wastes improves flow, reduces lead time, and increases overall efficiency and quality.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "TOC states that system throughput is limited by its weakest link (constraint or bottleneck). The five focusing steps are: identify the constraint, exploit it (maximize its throughput), subordinate everything else to the constraint, elevate the constraint (invest to increase its capacity), and repeat the process as the constraint shifts. This systematic approach continuously improves overall system performance.",

      "expected_answer": "A time study involves observing and timing a qualified worker performing a task using a stopwatch or video, recording multiple cycles, rating the worker's performance against normal pace, and applying allowances for personal needs, fatigue, and unavoidable delays. The standard time equals the observed time multiplied by the performance rating factor plus allowances, establishing a fair and achievable production standard.",

Its three factors are Availability (actual run time versus planned production time, accounting for downtime), Performance (actual cycle time versus ideal cycle time, capturing speed losses), and Quality (good units versus total units produced, capturing defects). World-class OEE is typically considered 85% or above.",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Kanban is a visual signaling system that authorizes production or material movement only when downstream processes consume inventory, creating a pull-based flow. Cards or signals limit work-in-process inventory between stations, prevent overproduction, expose process problems quickly, and synchronize production with actual demand rather than forecasts, supporting just-in-time manufacturing principles.",

By applying models (M/M/1, M/M/c, etc.), the engineer can evaluate trade-offs between adding servers (cost) and reducing wait times, determine optimal staffing levels, and design buffer capacities to achieve target service levels while minimizing total system cost.",
