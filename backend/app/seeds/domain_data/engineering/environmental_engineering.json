      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Primary treatment removes settleable solids through screening and sedimentation. Secondary treatment uses biological processes such as activated sludge or trickling filters to degrade dissolved organic matter.

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "BOD measures the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed by microorganisms to decompose organic matter in water over a specified period, typically five days.
