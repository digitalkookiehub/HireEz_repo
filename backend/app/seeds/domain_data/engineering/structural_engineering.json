      "question_text": "Explain the difference between ultimate limit state (ULS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) in structural design.",
      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "ULS addresses the maximum load-carrying capacity of a structure, ensuring it does not collapse or become unstable under factored loads. SLS addresses functional requirements under normal service loads, including deflection limits, vibration control, and crack width limitations to ensure occupant comfort and structural durability.",

      "question_text": "Describe the load path concept in structural engineering and why it is fundamental to safe design.",
      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "The load path describes the continuous route through which applied loads travel from their point of application through structural members to the foundation and into the ground. Every structural element must be connected in a way that transfers forces without interruption; a break in the load path can lead to progressive collapse or localized failure.",

      "question_text": "What are the key differences between reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete, and when would you choose one over the other?",
      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Reinforced concrete relies on steel reinforcement to resist tension after cracking, suitable for moderate spans and loads. Prestressed concrete applies a compressive force to the concrete before loading, reducing or eliminating tensile stresses, enabling longer spans, shallower sections, and better crack control, making it ideal for bridges, parking structures, and long-span beams.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Ductility is the ability of a structure to undergo large deformations beyond the elastic limit without sudden failure. In seismic design, ductile detailing includes closely spaced transverse reinforcement in plastic hinge zones, proper anchorage of reinforcing bars, capacity design principles to ensure flexural yielding occurs before brittle shear failure, and strong-column weak-beam hierarchy.",

      "question_text": "How do you determine the effective length factor (K) for columns, and why does it matter for buckling analysis?",
      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "The effective length factor K accounts for the column's end conditions (fixed, pinned, or free) and whether the frame is braced or unbraced. It modifies the actual column length to an equivalent length for Euler buckling calculations. Incorrect K values lead to under- or over-estimation of buckling capacity, directly affecting the safety and economy of column design.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "FEA discretizes a structure into small elements, applies material properties, boundary conditions, and loads, then solves equilibrium equations to determine displacements, stresses, and reactions. Key assumptions include element type selection, mesh density, material behavior (linear vs. nonlinear), connection modeling, and boundary condition idealization, all of which significantly influence accuracy.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Factors include soil bearing capacity, groundwater conditions, building loads and settlement tolerances, adjacent structures, site access, construction cost, and schedule. Evaluation involves geotechnical investigation, bearing capacity calculations, settlement analysis, and comparison of shallow foundations (spread footings, mats) versus deep foundations (piles, drilled shafts) based on site-specific conditions.",

      "question_text": "Explain the concept of moment redistribution in continuous concrete beams and the conditions under which it is permitted.",
      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Moment redistribution allows designers to reduce peak negative moments at supports and increase positive moments at midspan, reflecting the actual inelastic behavior of continuous beams. It is permitted when sections have adequate ductility (limited neutral axis depth), is typically capped at 10-30% depending on the code, and leads to more practical reinforcement layouts.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Wind loads are applied as pressure on the building envelope, transferred to floor diaphragms, which then distribute the lateral force to the vertical lateral force-resisting system (moment frames, braced frames, or shear walls) in proportion to their relative stiffness. These vertical elements carry the forces down to the foundation, which transfers them to the ground.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "A structural peer review provides an independent check of structural design assumptions, calculations, drawings, and specifications by a qualified engineer not involved in the original design. It is most valuable at the schematic design stage to verify the structural concept, during detailed design for calculation verification, and before construction for drawing and specification review.",
