      "question_text": "What is the difference between one-way and two-way slab design, and how do you determine which to use?",
      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "A one-way slab carries load primarily in one direction when the ratio of longer span to shorter span exceeds 2. A two-way slab carries load in both directions when the ratio is less than or equal to 2. The choice depends on the aspect ratio of the panel, support conditions, and loading requirements. Two-way slabs are more efficient for square or near-square panels.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Bearing capacity is the maximum pressure a soil can support without shear failure. Factors include soil type and properties (cohesion, angle of internal friction), depth of foundation, width of footing, groundwater table position, soil layering, and loading conditions. Terzaghi's bearing capacity equation is commonly used to calculate ultimate bearing capacity considering these factors.",

      "expected_answer": "The CBR test measures the strength of subgrade soil or base course material for pavement design. It compares the penetration resistance of a soil sample to that of a standard crushed stone. The CBR value is expressed as a percentage and is used to determine the required pavement thickness. Higher CBR values indicate stronger materials requiring thinner pavement layers.",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Retaining wall design involves analyzing lateral earth pressure (active and passive), surcharge loads, hydrostatic pressure, seismic forces, and self-weight. The wall must be checked for overturning stability (factor of safety >= 2), sliding stability (FOS >= 1.5), bearing capacity of foundation soil, and overall global stability. Rankine's or Coulomb's theory is used to calculate earth pressures. Drainage provisions are critical to prevent hydrostatic buildup.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "The water-cement ratio directly affects concrete strength, durability, and workability. A lower water-cement ratio produces stronger, more durable concrete but reduces workability. A higher ratio increases workability but reduces strength and durability. The typical range is 0.4-0.6. Abrams' law states that concrete strength is inversely proportional to the water-cement ratio. Admixtures like plasticizers can improve workability without increasing water content.",

Conduct a structural assessment of the affected building. Document all observations and monitoring data. Coordinate with the building owner, insurance, and regulatory authorities.

      "expected_answer": "A culvert is a structure with a span typically less than 6 meters, usually embedded in soil with the roadway above, designed primarily for water conveyance. A bridge has a span exceeding 6 meters with clear separation between the deck and waterway. Design considerations for culverts include hydraulic capacity, inlet/outlet conditions, and fill height.

They consist of surface course, base course, and sub-base over subgrade. Rigid pavements use Portland cement concrete slabs that distribute loads over a wide area through beam action. Flexible pavements are cheaper initially but need more maintenance. Rigid pavements have higher initial cost but longer life and lower maintenance. Design methods differ: flexible uses CBR-based methods while rigid uses Westergaard analysis.",

Delineate catchment areas and calculate runoff using the Rational Method or SCS Curve Number method. Size pipes and channels using Manning's equation for open channels and Darcy-Weisbach for pressurized flow. Consider peak flow attenuation through detention basins.

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Prestressed concrete involves applying a compressive force to concrete before service loads are applied, using high-strength steel tendons. This pre-compression offsets tensile stresses from external loads. There are two methods: pre-tensioning (tendons stressed before concrete placement) and post-tensioning (tendons stressed after concrete hardens). Advantages include: reduced or eliminated cracking, smaller cross-sections for same load, longer spans possible, better durability, reduced deflections, and more efficient use of high-strength materials. It is commonly used in bridges, long-span beams, and precast elements.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Liquefaction occurs when saturated, loose, sandy soil loses strength and stiffness due to earthquake-induced cyclic loading, causing it to behave like a liquid. This can lead to settlement, lateral spreading, and foundation failure. Assessment involves SPT or CPT testing to evaluate liquefaction potential. Mitigation measures include deep foundations (piles) extending to non-liquefiable layers, ground improvement techniques (vibro-compaction, stone columns, grouting), soil replacement, and dewatering. Foundation design in seismic zones must account for reduced bearing capacity during liquefaction events.",

It depends on the time factor, which relates to soil permeability, compressibility, drainage path length, and elapsed time. Terzaghi's one-dimensional consolidation theory is used to predict the rate of settlement. The coefficient of consolidation (Cv) is determined from laboratory oedometer tests. This is critical for predicting how quickly soft clay deposits will settle under applied loads and for designing preloading or vertical drain programs to accelerate consolidation.",
