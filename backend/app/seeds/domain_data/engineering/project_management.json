      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "CPM identifies the longest sequence of dependent activities (the critical path) that determines the shortest possible project duration. By calculating early start, early finish, late start, and late finish times for each activity, it reveals which tasks have zero float and therefore cannot be delayed without extending the project completion date.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "EVM integrates scope, schedule, and cost data to measure project performance. CPI (Cost Performance Index) equals earned value divided by actual cost, indicating cost efficiency; a CPI below 1.0 means over budget. SPI (Schedule Performance Index) equals earned value divided by planned value, indicating schedule efficiency; an SPI below 1.0 means behind schedule.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "A WBS hierarchically decomposes the total project scope into smaller, manageable work packages. The process involves identifying major deliverables, progressively breaking them into smaller components until each work package can be reliably estimated, assigned, and tracked. It forms the foundation for scheduling, cost estimating, risk analysis, and responsibility assignment.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Monte Carlo simulation assigns probability distributions (triangular, PERT, or uniform) to activity durations, then runs thousands of iterations to model the range of possible project outcomes. The result is a probability distribution of completion dates and costs, allowing project managers to set realistic targets, quantify schedule risk, and identify which activities contribute most to overall uncertainty.",

      "question_text": "Explain the difference between fast-tracking and crashing as schedule compression techniques.",
      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Fast-tracking involves performing sequential activities in parallel to shorten the schedule, which increases risk due to potential rework. Crashing adds resources to critical path activities to reduce their duration, which increases cost. Both techniques shorten the schedule but with different trade-offs: fast-tracking increases risk while crashing increases budget.",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "A RACI matrix assigns roles for each task or deliverable: Responsible (does the work), Accountable (has authority and ownership), Consulted (provides input), and Informed (kept updated). It eliminates ambiguity about who does what, prevents duplication of effort, ensures all necessary stakeholders are engaged, and clarifies escalation paths.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Common EAC formulas include: BAC/CPI (assumes current cost efficiency continues), AC + bottom-up ETC (re-estimates remaining work), AC + (BAC - EV) (assumes future work is on budget), and BAC/(CPI x SPI) (considers both cost and schedule performance). Selection depends on whether past variances are expected to continue or were atypical.",

      "expected_answer": "The project charter formally authorizes the project, defines high-level objectives, scope boundaries, key stakeholders, and initial budget and timeline. The project management plan is a detailed document developed later that describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled across all knowledge areas including scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management.",
