      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Material balance applies the conservation of mass principle, stating that input minus output plus generation minus consumption equals accumulation. In a CSTR at steady state, accumulation is zero, so the feed rate of reactants equals the outflow plus the rate of reaction consumption within the reactor volume.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "In an ideal PFR, all fluid elements spend exactly the same amount of time in the reactor, resulting in a uniform residence time.
