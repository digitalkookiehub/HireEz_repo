      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "In a star connection, one end of each winding is connected to a common neutral point, providing two voltages (line and phase, where V_line = sqrt(3) * V_phase). Line current equals phase current. In a delta connection, windings are connected end-to-end forming a closed loop with no neutral point. Line voltage equals phase voltage, but I_line = sqrt(3) * I_phase. Star is used for long-distance transmission (lower voltage per winding) and delta for shorter distribution. Motors often start in star and switch to delta to reduce starting current.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Power factor is the ratio of real power (kW) to apparent power (kVA), representing how effectively electrical power is being used. It ranges from 0 to 1 and equals the cosine of the phase angle between voltage and current. Low power factor means higher current for the same real power, causing increased losses, larger conductor requirements, and utility penalties. Improvement methods include: installing capacitor banks (most common), using synchronous condensers, synchronous motors at leading power factor, active power factor correction circuits, and avoiding lightly loaded induction motors.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "A transformer works on the principle of electromagnetic induction (Faraday's law). An alternating current in the primary winding creates a changing magnetic flux in the core, which induces an EMF in the secondary winding. The voltage ratio equals the turns ratio (V1/V2 = N1/N2). Efficiency is affected by: core losses (hysteresis and eddy current losses, constant regardless of load) and copper losses (I^2*R losses, vary with load squared). Maximum efficiency occurs when core losses equal copper losses. Typical efficiency ranges from 95-99% for power transformers.",

It is essential for: sizing circuit breakers and fuses (interrupting capacity must exceed maximum fault current), designing protective relay coordination schemes, determining equipment ratings (transformers, busbars, switchgear), evaluating system stability, and ensuring personnel safety. Analysis uses per-unit system calculations, Thevenin equivalent circuits, and symmetrical component methods for unbalanced faults.

Solid grounding provides lowest ground fault voltage but highest fault current. Resistance grounding limits fault current but allows fault detection.

It is simple, rugged, and self-starting. A synchronous motor runs exactly at synchronous speed (N = 120f/P) regardless of load. It requires DC excitation on the rotor and is not self-starting (needs damper windings or VFD). Synchronous motors can provide power factor correction by adjusting excitation. Induction motors are more common for general use while synchronous motors are used for large loads requiring constant speed or power factor improvement.",

Test types include spot reading (single measurement), time-resistance test (readings at intervals to check polarization index), and step voltage test (increasing voltage to detect weak spots).
