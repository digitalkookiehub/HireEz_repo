      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "Class I devices pose the lowest risk and are subject to general controls (e.g., tongue depressors). Class II devices require special controls and typically a 510(k) premarket notification demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device (e.g., powered wheelchairs).
