      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "A detailed cost estimate involves quantity takeoff from drawings and specifications, pricing labor, materials, and equipment for each work item, adding subcontractor quotes, calculating overhead and profit margins, and including contingencies. Key components are direct costs (labor, materials, equipment), indirect costs (supervision, temporary facilities, insurance), and markup for profit and contingency.",

      "question_type": "technical",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "expected_answer": "A Gantt chart is a bar chart showing task durations along a timeline, excellent for visual communication of the schedule to stakeholders. A network diagram shows logical dependencies between activities and enables critical path and float calculations. Gantt charts are used for presentation and tracking, while network diagrams are used for schedule analysis, optimization, and identifying the critical path.",
