The stress-strain curve for a ductile material shows: linear elastic region (obeying Hooke's law), proportional limit, elastic limit, yield point (upper and lower for mild steel), strain hardening region, ultimate tensile strength, necking, and fracture point. Young's modulus is the slope of the linear elastic region.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Zeroth Law: If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are in equilibrium with each other (basis for temperature measurement). First Law: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted (basis for energy balance in engines, turbines). Second Law: Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold; entropy of an isolated system always increases (limits engine efficiency, defines Carnot cycle). Third Law: Entropy approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero (relevant for cryogenics and low-temperature processes).",

Forging involves shaping metal through compressive forces at high temperature, producing stronger parts with better grain structure, ideal for high-strength components. Machining removes material from a workpiece using cutting tools for high precision and surface finish. Choice depends on part geometry, material, required strength, surface finish, production volume, and cost constraints.",

GD&T uses symbols and feature control frames to specify form, profile, orientation, location, and runout tolerances relative to datums. GD&T provides a cylindrical tolerance zone for position (58% more tolerance area than square zones), clearly defines functional relationships, reduces ambiguity, and enables better communication of design intent.
